# Punjab Smog Intelligence Platform

A real-time air quality monitoring and analysis dashboard for Punjab, Pakistan. This platform provides actionable insights on pollution patterns across 40+ districts, designed for environmental agencies, public health officials, researchers, and the general public.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://punjab-smog-dashboard.vercel.app/


## Overview

Punjab faces severe seasonal smog affecting millions of residents annually. This platform addresses the challenge by centralizing fragmented air quality data into a unified, interactive dashboard that enables data-driven decision making for environmental policy and public health advisories.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring** — Live PM2.5 and PM10 tracking across 40+ districts with automatic data refresh
- **Interactive Visualizations** — 10+ charts including trend comparisons, pollution rankings, and correlation analysis
- **Fire-Pollution Correlation** — Lag-based analysis (0-2 days) showing how agricultural fires impact air quality
- **Wind Pattern Analysis** — Wind rose diagrams and directional mapping to understand pollution transport
- **District Diagnostics** — Deep-dive analysis for individual districts with neighboring area comparisons
- **Report Generation** — One-click PDF and PowerPoint export for stakeholder presentations
- **Mobile Responsive** — Full functionality on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## How It Works
```
Data Sources → Pipeline → Database → Frontend → User
```

### 1. Data Collection
- **Air Quality Data:** PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from monitoring stations
- **Fire Data:** NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)
- **Weather Data:** Wind speed, wind direction from meteorological APIs

### 2. Data Pipeline
- GitHub Actions runs scheduled jobs to collect and process data
- Python scripts handle ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
- Processed data is pushed to the database

### 3. Database
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) stores all historical and real-time data
- Real-time subscriptions enable instant updates to connected clients
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures data protection

### 4. Frontend
- Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 modules for clean, maintainable code
- Plotly.js powers all interactive charts and maps
- Responsive CSS ensures usability across all devices

### 5. Deployment
- GitHub Actions handles CI/CD pipeline
- Vercel provides edge deployment with global CDN
- Automatic deployments on every push to main branch

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Supabase account
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/punjab-smog-dashboard.git
   cd punjab-smog-dashboard
```

2. Update `js/config.js` with your Supabase credentials
```javascript
   export const SUPABASE_URL = 'your-supabase-url';
   export const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-anon-key';
```

3. Serve locally
```bash
   npx serve .
```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Deployment

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Add environment secrets in GitHub:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy
